 # DMRG++ (in development)
  [Density matrix renormalization group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group) (DMRG) is a variational numerical technique to study the low-energy physics of many-body quantum systems.

  This algorithm constructs and minimizes trial wave functions, in the shape of [Matrix Product States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state) (MPS), iteratively in order to find the ground state of one-dimensional quantum systems with high precision.

  This implementation mainly follows the notation and steps in these articles:

## Installation
### Quick start
Git clone or copy & extract the project into a folder of your choosing.
**Make sure there are no spaces in your path!**.
The project can be built with a single command from a unix terminal. 
Simply launch the script `.\build.sh` found in the root folder to trigger a CMake build.

The script takes optional arguments, run `.\build.sh -h` to learn more.

The CMake build will check for dependencies and download them automatically if needed (see *Optional Requirements* below).
If the dependencies are found, the project is built and an executable is generated.

To run the executable, launch `.\run.sh`, or  `.\run.sh -h` to learn more. 



**Alternatively**, if you intend to develop or study the source code, some IDE's with CMake support can self-configure from the file CMakeLists.txt found in the project root folder. This
is perhaps an even simpler approach. Recommended: [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the C++ and CMake Tools extensions.


### Minimum Requirements
The following software is required to build the project:
 - C++ compiler with support for C++17 standard and libstdc++ standard library implementation  (version >= 7). Tested with two compilers:
    - GNU GCC versions 7 and 8 (these bundle libstdc++)
    - Clang version >= 5.0. (you need to manually install libstdc++ version >= 7, that comes bundled with gcc, for instance from `ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test`)
 - CMake version >= 3.9. If you compile CMake from source, remember to enable `curl` (`./bootstrap --system-curl`). 
 - *(For library compilation only) Fortran compiler, tested with gfortran-7 and gfortran-8.*
 
**Ubuntu** 17 or higher will have the versions required in the default repositories. For older distributions, use the ppa `ubuntu-toolchain-r/test` to get newer versions.

**Mac OSX** users are advised to use GNU GCC version 7 or 8 from homebrew. Install with `brew install gcc`. Clang from llvm 6.0 might work but you will have to link to GNU's `libstdc++.so` or `libstdc++.a` manually. The AppleClang compiler is not supported at all. 


### Optional Requirements
The compilation of DMRG++ requires several libraries. To meet the requirements, you have two options:

  1. **Automatic**: let cmake download and compile the libraries below from source into a local folder `libs/`. This is the default behavior if the library is not found on your system. Note that this does *NOT* make a system-wide install, so you can safely delete the `libs/` folder.
  2. **Manual**: install the libraries yourself with your favorite package manager (e.g. `apt` in ubuntu or `brew` in OSX). The build script will always attempt to find the libraries in your system first.
 
 The latter is recommended to avoid a lengthy compilation of these rather large libraries. If the compilation halts due to any library failing to compile or link, you can try installing/uninstalling that library from your package manager.
 
 #### List of libraries
 
 - **BLAS** and **LAPACK**. Required for Arpack. You can choose either [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) or [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) (OpenBLAS requires Fortran to compile from source). If both MKL and OpenBLAS are found in the system, MKL is preferred.
 - [**Eigen**](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for tensor and matrix and linear algebra (tested with version >= 3.3).
 - [**Arpack**](https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng) Eigenvalue solver based on Fortran. Note that this in turn requires LAPACK and BLAS libraries, both of which are included in OpenBLAS.
 - [**Arpackpp**](https://github.com/m-reuter/eigsolver_properties) C++ frontend for Arpack.
 - [**Elemental**](http://libelemental.org/) for full diagonalization of matrices.
 - [**HDF5**](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) for hdf5 binary output file support (tested with version >= 1.10).
 - [**GSL**](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for numerical integration (tested with version >= 2.4).

## Usage

The executable `build/Release/DMRG++` can be run without input parameters. By default it will try to find `input/input.cfg` the file
where the simulation parameters are defined. You can modify these parameters, o create a new input file and pass its (full or relative) path as a command-line argument.

The results from the simulation are saved under `output/` as hdf5-files. To view the data you can use any hdf5-viewer, such as HDFCompass.

The script `Data_analysis/data_analysis.py` (in progress) shows how to analyze the simulation data stored in the hdf5 files. You need to install the python package
`h5py` from pip or conda to read files in the hdf5 format.
