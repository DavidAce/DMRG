 # DMRG (in development)
  [Density matrix renormalization group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group) (DMRG) is a variational numerical technique to study the low-energy physics of many-body quantum systems.

  This algorithm constructs and minimizes trial wave functions, in the shape of [Matrix Product States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state) (MPS), iteratively in order to find the ground state of one-dimensional quantum systems with high precision.

  This implementation loosely follows the steps outlined in:

 * [g++-7 for -std=c++17 support](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/ubuntu/test) for newer features. To install in Ubuntu:
    ```
    > sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    > sudo apt update
    > sudo apt install gcc-7 g++-7
    ```
 * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for tensor support and SVD decomposition. **Included, no action needed**
 * [Spectra](https://spectralib.org/)  for eigenvalue-solver. **Included, no action needed**
 * [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) for hdf5-file storage support. To install in Ubuntu:
     ```
     sudo apt install libhdf5-dev libhdf5-10 libhdf5-cpp-11
     ```
 * [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for numerical integration. To install in Ubuntu: 
    ```
    sudo apt install libgsl-dev libgsl2
    ```
 

 ## Tensor index order convention.
 The tensor index order used here follows the convention:
 - physical indices first, from left to right or for MPO's, up to down.
 - other dimensions (like bond dimensions) next, from left to right.

 #### Example:
Consider a rank-3 tensor `G` with dimensions `d`, `a` and `b`. In diagrammatic tensor notation this is:
```
                 	    [d]          0
            G     =	[a]__|__[b] = 1__|__2
```

where after the second equality the index order is shown. In code this corresponds to

```
 Textra::Tensor3 G(d,a,b);
```

Similarly, we have for a rank-4 tensor `Theta`:

```
                                    [d] [d]                0   1
                Theta   =   [chia]___|___|___[chib] = 2 ___|___|___ 3
```

which in code reads

```
 Textra::Tensor4 G(d,d,chia,chib);
```
