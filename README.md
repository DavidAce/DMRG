 # DMRG++ (in development)
  [Density matrix renormalization group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_matrix_renormalization_group) (DMRG) is a variational numerical technique to study the low-energy1 physics of many-body quantum systems.

  This algorithm constructs and minimizes trial wave functions, in the shape of [Matrix Product States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state) (MPS), iteratively in order to find the ground state of one-dimensional quantum systems with high precision.

  This implementation loosely follows the Iter outlined in:

## Installation
### Quick start
Git clone or copy & extract the project into a folder of your choosing.
**Make sure there are no spaces in the output_folder!**.
The project can be built with a single command from a unix terminal. 
Simply launch the script `.\build.sh` found in the root folder. If you are feeling lucky, try
```
        cmake -E make_directory build/Release
        cd build/Release
        cmake -Bbuild/Release --build build -config Release ../../
        make
```
The build script will create subdirectories and use CMake to check for dependencies and download them automatically if needed (see *Optional Requirements* below).
If the dependencies are found, the project is built and an executable is generated.

To run executable, launch `.\run.sh`, containing

```
#!/bin/sh 
./build/Release/DMRG++
```


**Alternatively** some IDE's with CMake support can self-configure from the file CMakeLists.txt found in the project root folder. This
is perhaps an even simpler approach. Recommended: [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C++ and CMake Tools extensions.


### Minimum Requirements
The following software is required to build the project:
 - C++ compiler with support for c++17 standard and libstdc++ standard library implementation  (version >= 7). Tested with both
    - GNU GCC versions 7 and 8 (come with libstdc++ already)
    - Clang version >= 5.0. (you need to manually install libstdc++ version >= 7, that comes bundled with gcc, for instance from `ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test`)
 - CMake version >= 3.10. If you compile CMake from source, remember to enable `curl` (`./bootstrap --system-curl`). 
 
**Ubuntu** 17 or higher will have the versions required in the default repositories. For older distributions, use the ppa `ubuntu-toolchain-r/test` to get newer versions.

**Mac OSX** users are advised to use GNU GCC version 7 or 8 from homebrew. Install with `brew install gcc`. Clang and AppleClang compilers are not supported on OSX. 


### Optional Requirements
 You can chose to **either** 
  - let the build script compile the libraries below from source into `libs/`. This will happen automatically if the library is not found on your system. Note that this does *NOT* make a system-wide install, so you can safely delete the `libs/` folder.
  - (*recommended*) install the libraries yourself with your favorite package manager (e.g. `apt` in ubuntu or `brew` in OSX). The build script will always attempt to find the libraries in your system first.
 
 The latter is recommended to avoid a lengthy compilation of these rather large libraries. 
 
 #### Libraries
 
 - [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for tensor support and SVD decomposition (tested with version >= 3.3).
 - [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS) Required for Arpack. If you auto-install from source a Fortran compiler is required. Tested with gfortran version >= 7.
 - [Arpack](https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng) Eigenvalue solver based on fortran. Note that this in turn requires LAPACK and BLAS libraries.
 - [Arpackpp](https://github.com/m-reuter/arpackpp) C++ frontend for ARPACK.
 - [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) for hdf5-file env_storage support (tested with version >= 1.10).
 - [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for numerical integration (tested with version >= 2.4).

## Usage

The executable `./build/Release/DMRG++` can be run without input parameters. By default it will try to find `./input/input.cfg` the file
where the simulation parameters are defined. You can modify these parameters, o create a new input file and pass its (full or relative) path as a command-line argument.

The script `Data_analysis/data_analysis.py` can be used to analyze the simulation data, which is in hdf5 binary format. You can install
`h5py` from pip or conda to open such files.
