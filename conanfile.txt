### NOTE October 4 2020 ####
# Another flag that seems to fix weird release-only bugs is
#            -fno-strict-aliasing

### NOTE August 26 2020 ####
#
# Ceres started crashing on Tetralith again using -march=native.
# Tried to solve this issue once and for all.
# I've tried the following flags during compilation of DMRG++ and ceres-solver:
#
#           -DEIGEN_MALLOC_ALREADY_ALIGNED=[none,0,1]
#           -DEIGEN_MAX_ALIGN_BYTES=[none,16,32]
#           -march=[none,native]
#           -std=[none,c++17]
#
# Up until now, [0,16,none,none] has worked but now for some reason it stopped working.
# I noticed the -std=c++17 flag was not being passed on conan builds, so ceres defaulted to -std=c++14 instead.
# I fixed this in the conanfile.py of the ceres build. The -download-method=fetch method already had this fixed.
# When no Eigen flags were passed, and ceres-solver finally built with -std=c++17 the issues vanished.
# In the end what worked was [none,none,native,c++17] in both DMRG++ and ceres-solver.
# It is important that the same eigen setup is used in all compilation units, and c++17/c++14 seems to
# make Eigen infer some flags differently. In any case, settinc c++17 and no flags for eigen anywhere
# lets Eigen do its thing in the same way everywhere.
