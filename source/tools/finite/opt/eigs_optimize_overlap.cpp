     * Overlap optimization
     *
     * In overlap optimization we consider a local set of sites l of the L-site system,
     * usually this corresponds to l = 1 or up to l = 8 adjacent sites.
     *
     * A subspace in this context is a truncated basis, i.e. a small subset of eigenvectors
     * of the local "effective" Hamiltonian. The subspace is a set of k eigenvectors [x]
     * which have significant overlap with the current state |y⟩, i.e. we define k such that
     *
     *          ε > 1 - Σ_i^k |⟨x_i|y⟩|²,
     *
     * where ε is a small number that controls error of the truncation. A value ε ~1e-10 is
     * reasonable. Note that the truncation implies that k is smaller than the local
     * Hilbert space dimension.
     *
     * After having found a good subspace, the objective is to find the eigenvector that has
     * highest overlap toward the current state.
     *
     * It is worth noting some observations. Let {x} be the set of all eigenvectors
     * to the local effective Hamiltonian H_local.
     * Then, when the DMRG process is fully converged:
     *      - only one x_i has overlap ⟨x_i|y⟩ = 1
     *        Since the sum of all overlaps must add to 1, the rest have <x_j|y> = 0 when i != j.
     *      - This x is also the one that minimizes the energy variance.
     *
     * However, before the DMRG process has converged this is not true. Instead:
     *      - we have ⟨x_i|y⟩ > 0 for several i.
     *      - a linear combination of several x can have lower variance than any
     *        single x.
     *
     * Fully diagonalizing H_local yields all K eigenvectors {x}, but if H_local is too big this operation
     * becomes prohibitively expensive. Instead we resort to finding a subset with k << K eigenvectors [x],
     * whose eigenvalues are the k energies closest to the current energy. Usually the eigenvectors
     * which have some overlap ⟨x_i|y⟩ > 0 are found in the subset [x] if k is large enough.
     *
     * Overlap optimization steps
     *
     * Step 1)  Find a subspace [x], i.e. take a set of k eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian.
     *          Empirically, eigenvectors whose eigenvalues (energy) are closest to the current energy,
     *          tend to have nonzero overlap with the current vector |y⟩.
     *          On an iterative solver we keep increasing "nev" (number of requested eigenvectors) until
     *          the subspace error ε is small enough, or an eigenstate is found with overlap > 0.5.
     *
     * Step 2) Return the eigenstate with the highest overlap to the current state.
